project work for getting and cleaning data

## Description
Course project for getting and cleaning data is performed using data from UCI http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones . the purpose of this project is to collect, clean and tidy the data so that it is ready for further analysis

## Source data
The source data on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset for this work was used from this URL

## Information related to data sets
The experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age group of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, authors have captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
